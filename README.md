A desktop software for QR code photo grouping

The software is written in python and uses ttk to draw the interface

Using the QR code recognition open source engine from the WeChat team

This is a very simple software and I made as detailed notes as possible. If you have a lot of pictures that need to be organized, and the number of each group of these pictures is the same, and they all contain pictures of QR codes as intervals

Then this program will automatically group these pictures according to the information in the QR code

Hope this tool software can help youÔºÅ
